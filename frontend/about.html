                    <h3>Economic Independence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Women entrepreneurs break free from financial dependency and create wealth for themselves
                        and their families, ensuring long-term security and opportunity.

                    <p>
                        When women earn, they reinvest in their families and communities—education for children,
                        healthcare, and local development initiatives grow exponentially.

                    <p>
                        Economic independence gives women voice and agency in decision-making at home and in society,
                        accelerating the journey toward genuine gender equality.

                    <p>
                        Women entrepreneurs drive GDP growth, create jobs (mostly for other women), and bring diverse
                        perspectives that strengthen economies and markets.

                        Successful women entrepreneurs become role models, inspiring the next generation to dream bigger
                        and challenging societal norms around women's capabilities.

                        Women bring unique perspectives, creating innovative solutions to market problems. Diverse
                        businesses are statistically more creative and resilient.

                    <p class="founder-title">Founder & CEO, EmpowerHer</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            "I started EmpowerHer because I believed that every woman deserves the opportunity to
                            build her own destiny. Growing up, I witnessed incredible women—my mother, aunts, neighbors—
                            struggling not because they lacked talent or ambition, but because they lacked access to
                            the right resources and support.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After years in corporate leadership, I realized that the pinnacle of success isn't just
                            about personal achievement. It's about creating systems where others can achieve too.
                            EmpowerHer is that system.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Today, I'm humbled to see 50,000+ women transforming their lives through our platform.
                            These aren't just business successes—they're stories of independence, dignity, and
                            self-determination. A mother who can now send her daughter to the best school. A widow
                            who reclaimed her financial security. A girl who now believes she can do anything.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our vision is bold: a world where women entrepreneurship isn't a rarity but the norm.
                            Where every woman believes in her power to create and lead. Where economic independence
                            becomes a right, not a privilege.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you're reading this and you have a dream—trust it. You're not alone. We're here to
                            support you every step of the way.
